Phase 1: Single Dataset
1a.
The project is currently in a state where a 10,000 cell run showed pretty solid validation results
I want to scale up to the entire single cell dataset that I am working with (25000) cells then re validate on TRRUST and STRING
Once we are confident that the model is working well
  Covers most of the genome
  Validates well
I want to get this into a useable interactive format pretty early on
ie, Someone can say, type in two genes and the interface will show the most direct path between those two genes
or someone types in a single gene and it shows the nearby interactome
or someone types in a a bunch of genes and it shows how the genes connect together

1b.
Deep topological analysis
Assessment of "can we infer stream direction - Gene A is upstream of Gene B"


Phase 2: Multi Dataset
Currently the interactome is built on a single cell rna sequencing atlas with 25000 cells
I want to run this on multiple datasets independently, then cross validate on each other
If we are truly pulling the global interactome then two datasets should not show too much difference
Then I want to expand training across multiple datasets, by aligning networks, keeping stable connections and removing unstable
Finally, work on per cell type graphs. Where we find datasets of one major cell type, and run it against the global graph, defining what the network looks like for that cell type specifically
Also when the stiffness inference model is trained we might be able to use that to create a mechanically specific graph where certain sub networks are separated by stiffness
